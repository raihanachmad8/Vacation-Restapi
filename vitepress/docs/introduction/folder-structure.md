# Folder Structure

This guide outlines the recommended folder structure for a NestJS project using Prisma and MySQL. This structure helps maintain a clean and organized codebase, making it easier to manage and scale your application.

## Project Structure

Here is an example of the folder structure for a NestJS project with Prisma and MySQL:


## Folder and File Descriptions

### `prisma`

- **migrations/**: Contains database migration files generated by Prisma.
- **schema.prisma**: The Prisma schema file defining your data model.
- **seed.ts**: Script to seed the database with initial data.

### `src`

- **common/**: Contains reusable components such as decorators, DTOs, filters, guards, interceptors, pipes, and utility functions.
  - **decorators/**: Custom decorators for use across the application.
  - **dtos/**: Data Transfer Objects used for data validation and transfer.
  - **filters/**: Global and route-specific exception filters.
  - **guards/**: Custom guards for route protection.
  - **interceptors/**: Custom interceptors for request/response manipulation.
  - **pipes/**: Custom pipes for data transformation and validation.
  - **utils/**: Utility functions and helpers.

- **modules/**: Contains the feature modules of the application.
  - **auth/**: Authentication module with controllers, services, and related files.
    - **dtos/**: Data Transfer Objects specific to authentication.
    - **guards/**: Guards specific to authentication.
    - **strategies/**: Authentication strategies (e.g., JWT, local).
  - **user/**: User module with controllers, services, and related files.
