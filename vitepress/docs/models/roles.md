# Role Model

The `Role` model defines different roles within the application, each specifying a set of permissions and access rights.

## Fields

### `role_id`
- **Type**: string
- **Format**: uuid
- **Constraints**: primary key
- **Description**: A universally unique identifier (UUID) for the role, ensuring each role has a distinct identifier within the system.

### `role_name`
- **Type**: string
- **Constraints**: required, unique
- **Description**: The name of the role, which identifies its purpose or authority within the application.

### `created_at`
- **Type**: timestamp
- **Description**: The timestamp indicating when the role was created.

### `updated_at`
- **Type**: timestamp
- **Description**: The timestamp indicating when the role was last updated.

## Description

The `Role` model is essential for managing access control and permissions across the application. Each role is uniquely identified by a UUID and has a descriptive name (`role_name`) that helps in understanding its purpose or level of authority.

Roles play a critical role in user authentication and authorization processes, ensuring that users have appropriate access rights based on their assigned role. The timestamps (`created_at` and `updated_at`) track the creation and last modification times of each role, providing insights into its lifecycle and history within the system.

By defining roles clearly within the model, administrators and developers can effectively manage and configure access controls, enhancing security and operational efficiency within the application.
